**automatic scaling** in OpenShift.
In OpenShift, we typically use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** for automatic scaling.

Let’s go step-by-step:

---

## 1️⃣ **Pre-requisites**

* The application must have resource requests/limits defined (CPU/Memory).
* Metrics Server or Cluster Monitoring must be running because HPA depends on metrics.

Example:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
```

You can check if metrics are available:

```bash
oc get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes" | jq
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Create HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**

Example: scale deployment `my-app` based on CPU utilization:

```bash
oc autoscale deployment my-app --min 2 --max 10 --cpu-percent=50
```

* `--min 2`: Minimum 2 pods
* `--max 10`: Maximum 10 pods
* `--cpu-percent=50`: Target CPU utilization is 50%

---

## 3️⃣ **Check HPA status**

```bash
oc get hpa
```

Example output:

```bash
NAME     REFERENCE           TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
my-app   Deployment/my-app   30%/50%   2         10        2          5m
```

---

## 4️⃣ **Test AutoScaling (Optional)**

You can simulate load to see scaling in action (example using `hey` or `ab` command line tools).

---

## 5️⃣ **Delete HPA (if needed)**

```bash
oc delete hpa my-app
```

---

✅ **Note**: You can also autoscale based on memory or custom metrics (if configured).

---

👉 If you want, I can also show you:

* how to do this via YAML
* how to autoscale StatefulSets (bit different)
* how to troubleshoot HPA issues in OpenShift

---

Shall I show you full YAML example? 🔥
It’s very useful in DO280 & interviews.


Perfect! Let’s go one step deeper 🔎 — very useful for real work, DO280, and even RHCA exams.

## 🔧 **YAML for Memory-Based Autoscaling**

By default, most people autoscale only on CPU, but OpenShift (and Kubernetes) support memory-based scaling too.

Here’s the full YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa-memory
  namespace: dev
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
```

👉 **Note:**

* `averageUtilization: 60` means: scale if memory usage goes above 60% of requested memory (`requests.memory`).
* If you don’t set `requests.memory` in your Deployment, memory-based HPA will not work.

---

## 🔧 **YAML for Multi-Metric Autoscaling (CPU + Memory together)**

In OpenShift 4.x you can combine multiple metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa-multi
  namespace: dev
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
```

✅ This tells OpenShift:
**Scale if either CPU exceeds 50% OR memory exceeds 60%.**

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting HPA (Exam Useful 🔥)**

| Issue                     | Check                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| HPA not scaling           | `oc describe hpa` for events                                |
| No metrics                | `oc get --raw /apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1`                 |
| Resource requests not set | Check `oc get deployment -o yaml`                           |
| Metrics server error      | Check `openshift-monitoring` project                        |
| Check logs                | `oc logs deployment/metrics-server -n openshift-monitoring` |

✅ ✅ ✅
You’re now fully equipped to answer any OpenShift HPA question!

---

👉 Shall I also give you:

* ✅ **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) example**
* ✅ **Cluster Autoscaler concept**
* ✅ **DO280-style HPA exam question practice**

If you say *yes*, I’ll build you a small lab exercise 🚀.



Excellent — let’s turn this into **real exam-style practice**, just like DO280 or actual interviews.

---

# ✅ **Exercise 1: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) Lab**

### Scenario:

You are given a deployment named `web-app` in namespace `project-a`.
The deployment has:

* CPU request: 300m
* Memory request: 512Mi

Your task:

1️⃣ Create an HPA for `web-app` to:

* Minimum pods: 2
* Maximum pods: 8
* Scale on CPU utilization when CPU > 60%

2️⃣ Verify that the HPA is created successfully.

---

### ✅ **Solution YAML**

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: web-app-hpa
  namespace: project-a
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: web-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 8
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
```

Apply it:

```bash
oc apply -f web-app-hpa.yaml
```

Verify:

```bash
oc get hpa -n project-a
oc describe hpa web-app-hpa -n project-a
```

---

# ✅ **Exercise 2: Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**

> In OpenShift 4.x, VPA is supported via Operator (optional feature in some clusters).
> But here’s how you define VPA via YAML.

### Scenario:

You want OpenShift to automatically suggest updated resource limits for your deployment `web-app`.

---

### ✅ **VPA YAML Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: web-app-vpa
  namespace: project-a
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: Deployment
    name: web-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: '*'
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 256Mi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2Gi
```

Apply it:

```bash
oc apply -f web-app-vpa.yaml
```

👉 **Note:**

* VPA needs Vertical Pod Autoscaler Operator installed.
* Some DO280 exams don’t cover VPA but it’s good for higher certifications.

---

# ✅ **BONUS: Cluster Autoscaler (concept only)**

Cluster Autoscaler works at node level:

* Scales worker nodes automatically.
* Controlled via MachineSets.
* Mostly managed by OpenShift Admin (SRE / Cluster Admin role).

👉 Not tested directly in DO280 but useful in real-world OpenShift clusters.

---

# 🔥 **Summary Table (Super Useful for Exam Quick Review)**

| Type               | Resource               | Scaling                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| HPA                | Deployment/StatefulSet | Pod replica count            |
| VPA                | Deployment             | Pod resource requests/limits |
| Cluster Autoscaler | Cluster MachineSets    | Worker nodes                 |
